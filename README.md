# Node Pony

## What?
Routing algorithm practice for students of networking or data communication subjects. This application generates a graph and shows the shortest path to any node using [Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) or the [Bellman–Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman–Ford_algorithm).

## Why?
I wanted to create a bunch of examples for myself and others to practice.

## How?
```
npm install
npm test
```
Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
